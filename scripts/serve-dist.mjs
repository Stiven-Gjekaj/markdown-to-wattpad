/**
 * Serves the built site the way GitHub Pages serves it.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/serve-dist.mjs [port]
 *
 * `astro preview` cannot be used for this. Astro 7 runs it as a daemon: the
 * command returns at once and the server carries on in the background, which
 * a test runner reads as a server that died on startup.
 *
 * Serving the files here is also the more honest test. GitHub Pages is a dumb
 * static file host under a path prefix, and that is exactly what this is. A
 * development server that rewrites requests would hide a broken base path,
 * and a broken base path is a failure that builds cleanly and breaks every
 * link in production.
